Parallel to the High Peak Castle and Throne Room levels, the new Biomes introduce players to a rotten shipwreck where you will be hunted by eldritch horrors (of course) through the bowels of this spooky and haunted old vessel. The second Biome, The Lighthouse, introduces vertical exploration of a soaring tower in which players will scramble upward as fast as they can to outrun rising flames while simultaneously fending off highly skilled warriors who want nothing more than to end your run. This final Biome is as epic and refreshing as it is challenging.",
